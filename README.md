# Travel-Recommendation-System
Analyzing Travel Preferences Based on Demographic Factors and Recommending Tourist Destinations

# Abstract
Taking into account the critical role that tourism plays in the economy, the project seeks to solve the lack of a tailored tourist information platform. It is suggested to create a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to give travelers precise and customized recommendations. The research aims to increase recommendation precision by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and using cosine similarity for item comparisons. The work expands its relevance to a larger audience by using both global and Indian visitor statistics. In order to improve usability, an intuitive user interface is created, giving priority to recommendations with high similarity. Visual material, such as photographs and videos, is also incorporated to enrich the user experience and provide recommendations for hotels and travel modes (train, airline, etc.) depending on the trip's budget.
