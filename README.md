# Travel-Recommendation-System
Analyzing Travel Preferences Based on Demographic Factors and Recommending Tourist Destinations

# Abstract

The project aims to address the absence of a personalized tourist information platform, recognizing the crucial role of tourism in the economy. A hybrid recommendation system, combining content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, is proposed to provide tourists with accurate and tailored recommendations. By utilizing cosine similarity for item comparisons and implementing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the project seeks to improve recommendation precision. The work extends its reach to include both Indian and global tourist data, expanding its applicability to a wider audience. An intuitive user interface is developed to enhance usability, prioritizing high-similarity recommendations, and incorporating visual content like images and videos to enrich the user experience and suggest hotels, travel type (train, airplane etc.)  based on investment for the trip.
